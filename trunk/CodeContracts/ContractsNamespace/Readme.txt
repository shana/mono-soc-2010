Implementation of System.Diagnostics.Contracts namespace.
Currently in a stand-alone library that can be compiled and tested against .NET 3.5

Tests marked in category RunAgainstReference can be run against MS.NET 4.0 successfully.
Tests that trigger assertions cannot be run against MS.NET 4.0 because it is not possible
to intercept these assertions.

Implementation not yet completed.
Everything currently implemented passes all tests.
